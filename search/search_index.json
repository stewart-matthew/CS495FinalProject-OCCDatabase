Requirements Before getting started, ensure you have the following: Node.js \u2013 JavaScript runtime for running the web app locally Supabase Account \u2013 Free database and authentication service Git \u2013 For cloning the repository Docker (optional) \u2013 For containerized deployment GitHub Account (optional) \u2013 For Render deployments 1. Running the Web App Locally Step 1: Clone the Repository git clone https://github.com/stewart-matthew/CS495FinalProject-OCCDatabase.git cd CS495FinalProject-OCCDatabase Step 2: Install Node Dependencies npm install This installs React, Supabase JS, Tailwind CSS, and other dependencies. Step 3: Add Environment Variables Create a .env file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials: REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key Step 4: Run the Development Server npm start The web app will automatically open at http://localhost:3000 2. Running with Docker (Recommended) Docker provides a consistent, containerized environment for deployment. Step 1: Build the Docker Image docker build -t stewartmatthew6288/occ-site . Step 2: Push to Docker Hub (Optional) docker push stewartmatthew6288/occ-site Step 3: Run the Docker Container docker run -p 3000:80 stewartmatthew6288/occ-site Access the application at http://localhost:3000 3. Hosting on Render (Recommended) Render provides free static site and web service hosting with automatic deployments from GitHub. Prerequisites GitHub repository connected to Render Environment variables configured in Render dashboard Deployment Steps Step 1: Build the React App Locally (Optional \u2013 Verify Locally) npm run build This creates a build/ folder with optimized static files.

Making Changes After Installation Once the application is installed and running locally, developers can update the system by modifying the source code and, if necessary, adjusting Supabase database resources. 1. Clone and Open the Project Clone the repository onto your machine Open it in a code editor (such as VS Code) All application logic and UI code live inside the project directory 2. Modify the User Interface / Behavior Update existing React pages by editing files in: src/pages Update shared UI components in: src/components To create new pages or features, add a new file inside src/pages and follow the same structure and routing patterns as existing pages. 3. Modify Data and Business Logic To change tables, relationships, or stored data, use the Supabase SQL Editor. Any database changes should also be reflected in React code that reads from or writes to Supabase through: src/supabaseClient.js 4. Update Security and Access Rules If new tables or roles are added, update Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) policies. RLS must be consistent with the existing role and area team structure to avoid permissions issues. 5. Test and Redeploy After updates, run the application locally to verify functionality. When ready, rebuild and redeploy using the same Docker process described in the installation documentation. 2. Compiler, Languages, Build Management, Dependencies, and Automated Builds The OCC application is built using modern web technologies and does not require a traditional compiler. Languages Used JavaScript/JSX \u2014 frontend logic and UI SQL \u2014 Supabase database schema and RLS policies Framework / Compiler The project uses Create React App , powered internally by: Babel \u2014 compiles JSX Webpack \u2014 bundles the application This process happens automatically when you run: npm run build Build Management (npm) Build and development tasks use npm . Common commands: npm install # Install all project dependencies npm run build # Create an optimized production build npm start # Run the production build locally Dependencies All dependencies are defined in: package.json This file lists: Libraries (React, Supabase, TailwindCSS, etc.) Version numbers Build scripts Automated Builds (Docker) Docker is used to produce repeatable and consistent builds. A new Docker image is created using the included Dockerfile : docker build . Or build and run together: docker compose up --build No CI/CD pipeline is used \u2014 Docker itself handles build automation. 3. Backlog, Bugs, and Major Maintenance Issues Backlog and Bug Tracking All tasks, backlog items, and bug reports are tracked in the project\u2019s Backlog Excel document . Major Issues / Technical Call-Outs 1. Database & RLS Retrofitting Whenever new tables, foreign keys, or roles are added: New RLS policies must be created. Permissions must match existing role structures. This is the most common source of required retrofitting. Examples requiring RLS updates: New role types New tables (events, volunteer hours, etc.) New foreign key relationships 2. Migrating Data to New Schema Versions Changes to tables such as: team_members churches positions member_positions may require: Manual data migration Updating foreign-key relations Updating dashboards and UI components Improper schema changes can introduce breaking issues. 3. Supabase Feature Updates Supabase updates may affect: Authentication SQL/PostgreSQL capability Storage policies Supabase JS client API Major upgrades may require updating code and policies. 4. Docker Environment Updates Updating Docker-based environments may require: Updating the Node.js version Updating base images Adding new services (Redis, workers, etc.) Developers may need to modify the Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml . 5. Long-Term Scalability Concerns If the system grows significantly: Add indexes for large tables Optimize heavy or repeated queries Upgrade Supabase tiers to handle increased load This is a future concern but important for maintainers. 4. Style Expectations The OCC application follows consistent coding and UI practices: Functional React components camelCase for variables and functions PascalCase for component names TailwindCSS for styling Reusable UI lives in: src/components Full pages live in: src/pages All Supabase logic goes through: supabaseClient.js Code should remain readable, modular, and match existing patterns. 5. Automated Testing The project uses Create React App\u2019s default testing setup ( Jest + React Testing Library ). Location of Test Files Main test file: src/App.test.js Testing configuration: src/setupTests.js Additional tests follow the pattern: ComponentName.test.js Running Tests Run in watch mode: npm test Run a single test pass (CI mode): CI=true npm test Currently, the project includes only the default tests.
